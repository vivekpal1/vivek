description: Here is why I love to code in Javascript

I started learning Javascript when I was in 9th standard. Although I discontinued it in 11th. But when I seriously started learning it last year, I felt love to code in it.
Many people assume that if you love JS, then you tried no other language. But I think that it is not true. Every language is made for specific purpose. As Javascript is mainly for web development, the thing I do most.
I have also tried to code Python and C. It doesn't mean that I hate these languages. It's just that Javascript is the language, which I code the most.

#### I can do many things with Javascript

- I can create front end of website and even add awesome UI and UX to it using **[React](https://reactjs.org), Vue, [Angular](https://angular.io), with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), Chakra Ui, Material UI, Bootstrap, etc**

- I can do backend things using **[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org), Express, MongoDB, Firebase, etc**

- How can one forget about 3D libraries and frameworks, Yes you can create 3D models on a webpage using **[Three.js](https://threejs.org), Babylon.js, etc**

- I can create native android and iOS applications with same code of js using **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev)**

- I can create desktop applications using js using **[Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org)**

- Machine Learning **[TensorFlow.js](https://www.electronjs.org)**

- GPU accelerated Neural networks in JavaScript using **[Brain.js](https://brain.js.org/#/)**


### Other Interesting things about Javascript

#### Destructuring in Javascript

[The destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)  syntax is an **ES6** feature, that allows you to unpack values from an array or an object into separate variables.

#### Browser Extensions

Browser Extensions can’t be developed without JS. As extensions’ development focus on doing most of the work on the client-side.

#### Beginner friendly but also powerful

JavaScript is one of the easiest languages for beginners. But it is also one of the most powerful languages. If you have a web browser on your computer that is all you need to write JavaScript. One of the biggest community is available on the internet.
There is no other language that I have seen which is as versatile as JavaScript. But remember learning JavaScript is easy but becoming a good JavaScript developer is quite hard.
It can run any device, in a browser, mobile devices, server-side, Desktop apps, OS, IoT, robots, virtual reality, smartwatches, etc.

#### Metaprogramming

JavaScript has great support for Metaprogramming. It provides the Proxy and Reflect objects that allow you to intercept and define custom behavior to existing language operators. Definitely an advanced feature which has its own use-cases.

#### Less verbose and clean syntax

It definitely is possible to write unreadable code in JavaScript but at the same time you can write beautiful expressive code as well and I find the JS syntax more readable than many other languages.
