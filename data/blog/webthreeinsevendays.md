### What the hell is Web3?
---
Today we are much familiar with some technologies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter. These all are web 2 technologies. They are owend by big tech giants and are centralized.  The data of billions of users across the world is centralized and dependant on only a handful of tech companies. These Centralized platforms can at any time change the rules and all terms and conditions. Thay even can manupulate or sell the data of users to other organizations.

And if let's say, Youtube bans a creatorâ€™s channel, the ability to access the massive audience on that platforms is permanently lost for that creator.
There comes the Web3 to solve all these problems. 
Web3 is the next phase of web development that may be powered by blockchain at its core. So, the data and computing power is not centralized like Web 2. 
This means that there is no central point of failure and that there could be anywhere from 10 to 10 million individual computers validating transactions, storing data, or providing computing power to back the applications happening on Web 3.
If you want to learn more, how web 3 is way ahead of web 2 you can read official documentation of Ethereum. [Read Here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/)

### How I get started with Web3
---
As I already familar with basic web technologies, I was eager to learn about Web 3. Podcasts, blogs, and tweets from web 3 experts pushed me to learn it within few days. I started learning some conceps of blockchain. I found blockchains are an incredible piece of technology, but they also aren't trivial to learn. You'll have to put some time into it to understand. I just watched this 16 hours full one shot tutorial in Solidity and Python, from freeCodeCamp. I also listend to some podcasts and read articles about on Smart Contracts and Blockchain. I will recommend insureblocks.com podcast to anyone who wants to learn about web 3.
