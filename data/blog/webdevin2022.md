Gone were the days of the web when you had to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery. Web Development is always evolving very fast. Many frameworks are coming day by day. NPM has become one of the biggest package managers in the world. Thats makes one of the toughest decision to choose most suitable framework for you. 

Here is the roadmap for learning web development as a beginner in 2022.


## Getting Started

---

We have 3 paths:

   - Frontend developer - Focuses on the coding and creation of elements and features of a website that will then be seen by the user. Build with the user in mind.
   - Backend developer - Back end development focuses on the server side of the website where users can’t see. It’s what makes a site interactive.
   - Full-stack developer - Full stack developer is a combination of both frontend and backend developer. They can create a website that can be seen by the user and interacted with by the server.

   I myself is a frontend developer, who is now learning backend development.

   This Roadmap focused for full-stack development. So you can choose any of your suitable path.

### Fundamental Skills

[CS50](https://youtu.be/eulnSXkhE7I)

- Use git and github in all your projects.

### Frontend Development

You must have master all Fundamental Skills mentioned above.
For front end development other than above HTML knowledge you must lean basics of 

- [SEO](https://youtu.be/MYE6T_gd7H0)

- [Web Accessibility](https://youtu.be/-ao_Kc_8rpE)

Along with those fundamentals you can also learn some basics of Web Design.

- After basics of CSS now you can go with flexbox, grid, animations, transitions, and more advanced CSS.

You can also go with CSS preprocessors like Sass, Less, etc. (But not recommended from me)

- Learn about package managers like [NPM](https://youtu.be/P3aKRdUyr0s), [Yarn (Recommended)](https://youtu.be/g9_6KmiBISk) and webpack.

In 2022 I will not recommend Bootstrap with a big no to jquery.
Instead Lean Tailwind:

- TailwindCSS -

After Learning React.js Go ahead with React frameworks such as 

- Next JS. (Useful for server side rendering)

[CodeWithHarry-Hindi-course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agtWvR_TZdb_r0dNI8-lDwG)

Also if you have learned Vue.js you can go ahead and learn Nuxt.js.

- Jest for testing.
- TypeScript for type checking.
- Three.js for 3D graphics.

- For Mobile Apps - React Native
- For Desktop Apps - Electron
