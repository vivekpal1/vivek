I was leaning normal Web Development. Thus also eager to learn about blockchain. Here I precised how you can learn blockchain in less time.


## What the hell is Web3?

---

Today we are much familiar with some technologies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter. These all are web 2 technologies. They are owend by big tech giants and are centralized.

The data of billions of users across the world is centralized and dependant on only a handful of tech companies. These Centralized platforms can at any time change the rules and all terms and conditions. Thay even can manupulate or sell the data of users to other organizations.

And if let's say, Youtube bans a creatorâ€™s channel, the ability to access the massive audience on that platforms is permanently lost for that creator.
There comes the Web3 to solve all these problems.
Platforms like **[Odysee](https://odysee.com/)** are coming with web3 technologies to solve this problem.

Web3 is the next phase of web development that may be powered by blockchain at its core. So, the data and computing power is not centralized like Web 2.

This means that there is no central point of failure and that there could be anywhere from 10 to 10 million individual computers validating transactions, storing data, or providing computing power to back the applications happening on Web 3.


### How I get started with Web3
---

Podcasts, blogs, and tweets from web 3 experts pushed me to learn it within few days. 
Seven days are not sufficient to learn whole blockchain development. I just learned some concepsts like solidity and smart contracts and fundamentals of blockchain technology. I found blockchains are an incredible piece of technology, but they also aren't trivial to learn. You'll have to put some time into it to understand.

To learn About Smart Contracts and Solidity, 
I just watched this famous 16 hours full one shot tutorial in Solidity and Python, from freeCodeCamp. https://youtu.be/M576WGiDBdQ

I also listend to some podcasts and read articles about on Smart Contracts and Blockchain. I will recommend https://insureblocks.com podcast to anyone who wants to learn about web 3.

### If you want to learn Blockchain
---

- Learn The Fundamentals of Computer Science
  Any fundamental courses like [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) would be suffiecient.

- If you already know Front-End Development, then it's a win win for you, go ahead.
  Web 2.0 Skills like HTML, CSS, Javascript, React will give you a head start into Web3.

- Learn Fundamentals of Blockchain and Smart Contracts with Solidity.
 [Creating Zombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) will help you to learn solidity.

- Learn about Crypto Wallet like Metamask

- Then you can go ahead with dapps and learn frameworks such as [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.2/) and [Ethers.js]() which I currently also learning.

- You can refer [Dapp University](https://www.youtube.com/c/DappUniversity/playlists) Youtube Channel.


I will recommend this tutorial if you want roadmap to Highly Paid Blockchain Developer. https://youtu.be/uGPC9wNTBbw
